# .dockerignore specifies which files and directories to exclude when building a Docker image
# This improves build performance and reduces image size

# Node modules directory - no need to copy as we install dependencies in the container
# This saves significant space and improves build time
node_modules

# Build output directory - we'll generate this during the build process inside the container
dist

# Version control files and directories - not needed in the image
.git
.gitignore

# Environment variable files - typically contain sensitive data and are environment-specific
# These should be provided at runtime or via Docker environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Log files - not needed in the image and may contain sensitive information
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*

# Editor configuration files - specific to developers' environments, not needed in production
.vscode
.idea
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?

# Docker-related files - not needed inside the Docker image itself
# Including these would be redundant and unnecessary
